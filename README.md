# ðŸª¨ Strike Weather: A Data Journey into Summer 1984

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the weather conditions during the summer of 1984, a period remembered by miners as "strike weather." The analysis uses historical weather data from the UK Met Office to investigate whether the summer of 1984 was unusually hot and dry.

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

- **`1984_summer_weather_analysis.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.
- **`/code/output/`**: Directory containing interactive HTML visualizations generated by the notebook.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Weather data for Cardiff, Sheffield, and Waddington was fetched from the UK Met Office.
   - Data includes monthly maximum temperatures, rainfall, and sunshine hours.

2. **Key Questions**:
   - Was the summer of 1984 unusually hot or dry compared to other years?
   - How does 1984 compare to the climatology baseline (1977â€“2006)?

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Interactive line plots for temperature, rainfall, and sunshine trends.
   - Scatter plots showing z-scores for temperature and rainfall anomalies.

4. **Findings**:
   - Summer 1984 was hotter and drier than the climatology baseline, aligning with miners' memories of "strike weather."

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Notebook

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:
     ```
     pandas
     requests
     matplotlib
     plotly
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `1984_summer_weather_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to fetch data, process it, and generate visualizations.

3. **View Outputs**:
   - Interactive visualizations are saved as HTML files in the `/code/output/` directory.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources

- UK Met Office station data:
  - [Sheffield](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/sheffielddata.txt)
  - [Waddington](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/waddingtondata.txt)
  - [Cardiff](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/cardiffdata.txt)

## ðŸ§­ Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Missing values replaced with `NaN`.
  - Numeric columns cleaned and converted to appropriate data types.

- **Climatology Baseline**:
  - The period 1977â€“2006 was used as a reference for "normal" weather conditions.

- **Z-Score Calculation**:
  - Standardized anomalies for temperature and rainfall were calculated to identify unusual years.

## ðŸ“– Interpretation

The analysis reveals that the summer of 1984 was indeed an outlier, characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall. This supports the miners' recollection of "strike weather" as a defining feature of that summer.

## ðŸŽ¤ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how historical weather data can provide context to collective memories. While data cannot fully capture lived experiences, it offers a lens to better understand them.
